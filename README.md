# 🎥🔍 video_content_search

**video_content_search** is a multimodal search library that enables searching inside video content using **text**, **image**, or **audio** queries — and returns semantically relevant results from the transcript, screenshots, and soundbites of the video.

---

It includes:

* A data pipeline to prepare video modalities (images, text, audio) for insertion into a vector store
* A vector database interface for Weaviate (`WeviateMultimodal`)
* Support for multimodal similarity search across text, image, and audio using ImageBind
* A Gradio-powered web app for demoing and exploring search results

## ✨ Features

- Parsing video into modalities (image, audio and text) and preparing each for vector store
- 🔤 Text-based semantic search across video transcripts
- 🖼️ Image-based search for matching video frames
- 🔊 Audio-based search for retrieving soundbites
- ⏱️ Returns video ID and timestamp for all results
- 🧠 Multimodal embedding and retrieval using Weaviate vector DB

## 🚀 Demo App

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Poetry
- Weaviate running in docker
- Imagebind running in docker
- Whisper
- Gradio


▶️ Run the Gradio App

First, make sure the video_content_search package is available via Poetry.

✅ 1. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
poetry install
This installs both the main package (video_content_search) and the Gradio app dependencies defined in pyproject.toml.

🚀 2. Launch the App
bash
Copy
Edit
poetry run python app/gradio_app.py
This will start the Gradio web interface where you can search using text, image, or audio, and view results retrieved from your Weaviate multimodal collection.



This launches a Gradio web UI where you can:

1. Enter text
2. Upload an image
3. Record or upload audio and
4. get matching text/image/audio chunks from the video with their video_id and timestamp.


🧠 How It Works
When a user submits a query:

* The app encodes it based on its modality (text/image/audio)
* Queries Weaviate for top-k similar results across all 3 modalities
* Decodes results (e.g., base64 images, audio bytes)
* Displays them in Gradio, along with their metadata

Each result includes:
- Semantic similarity score 
- Video ID 
- Timestamp in the video
